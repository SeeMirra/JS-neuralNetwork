# JS-neuralNetwork
This neural network has a single layer with randomly initialized weights and uses the sigmoid activation function. It takes an array of inputs and calculates the output using a forward propagation step. You can extend this basic neural network by adding additional layers and implementing a training function for updating the weights.
